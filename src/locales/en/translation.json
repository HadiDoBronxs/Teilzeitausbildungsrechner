        "question": "How is the part-time duration calculated?",
        "answer": "We divide your desired weekly hours by the full-time hours to get the part-time factor. We apply this factor to the base duration after all reductions and then check protection limits (at least the chamber minimum, at most 1.5 × the standard duration).",

        "question": "What does the 50% rule mean?",
        "answer": "Part-time must be at least 50% of full-time hours. If you are below that, we cannot calculate and show an error.",

        "question": "Can I work below 50%?",
        "answer": "The calculator does not support that because it is outside the usual rule. Please talk to your chamber and company if you plan less than 50%.",

        "answer": "We stop the calculation and show a clear message, for example when values are outside the allowed range or missing.",

      "capReduction": {
        "question": "Why is my reduction capped?",
        "answer": "We apply maximum reductions (for example 6 months) and a protection limit: part-time lasts at most 1.5 × the standard duration. This keeps results realistic and chamber-compliant.",
